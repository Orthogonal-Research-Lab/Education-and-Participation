Notes on the [Google Summer of Code roadmap](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Summer%20of%20Code%20Roadmap/GSoC-roadmap.png): 

1) the top branch are projects in the DevoWorm group stream, the bottom branch are projects in the Orthgonal Research and Education Lab stream.

2) there are connections between the two streams as shown between 2018 and 2019. 

3) as of November 2019, the 2020 topics are tentative. This is the direction we would like to go in, but this will depend on the final proposals.
