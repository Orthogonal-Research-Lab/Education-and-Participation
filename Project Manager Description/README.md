The Lab Manager will serve as a leader and integral team member with respect to operational and functional aspects of the lab. The Lab Manager will work closely with the Head Scientist/Principal Investigators to facilitate an inclusive and open lab environment. The Lab Manager should help develop and maintain our mission. This involves providing logistical support for research, educational, and outreach activities. Yet the Lab Manager will also be given space to develop academic projects and professional activities of their own. A project manager as well as a mentor, the Lab Manager works with lab members to overcome obstacles in research and find avenues for scholastic growth and development.

## Primary Responsibilities 
**Project Management & Administrative Assistance**: The primary role of the Lab Manager is to facilitate the operational activities of the lab. This includes tracking projects within GitHub issues & project boards. Regular communication with the Head Scientist  is required, in addition to maintaining check-ins and open communication with other lab members; the lab manager can be an intermediary between lab members and the Head Scientist. The Lab Manager will assist lab members with the development of their projects, in accordance with lab principles for collaboration and open science.

*Core Responsibilities*
- Coordination with Head Scientist and other members to facilitate lab projects and communications.
  - Regular updates and maintenance of GitHub project boards, issues, and related items as arising within weekly discussions or lab meetings.

  - Including introduction to GitHub, Slack, and previous projects/developments within the lab
- Active presence in lab activities
  - Regular office hours, 1-2 hr/wk
  - Attendance of Saturday Morning Neurosim, DevoWorm lab weekly meetings, in addition to other meetings organized by the lab as needed. 

**Mentorship & Professional Development**: The Lab Manager is invested in the development of lab members, and seeks to find resources needed for their success and furtherance on their projects. Working with the Head Scientist, the Lab Manager will facilitate the development of lab members’ scientific & academic literacy, as well as provide advice and opportunities for further engagement of related topics. 

**Open Science and Community Engagement**: Understanding of the concept and goals of an “[alt-academic institution](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/4k3z6/)”. The Lab Manager will play a public-facing role in the operation of the lab.
