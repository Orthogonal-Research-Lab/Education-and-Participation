Cosmic Embryogenesis  [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Vidal2010.pdf)  

Modern science has shown that there are two trends at play in cosmic evolution. First, a tendency to produce more order, with the emergence of more and more complex systems, from galaxies, stars, planets, to plants, humans and our technological society. Secondly, the second law of thermodynamics applied to the universe as a whole implies that in the far-future the universe will irreversibly go toward a state of maximum disorder. The outcome of those two opposite trends remains unsettled.

Is there a development at play at the cosmological scale? Teilhard de Chardin suggested so when he coined the term “Cosmic Embryogenesis”. We look at nuclear and chemical synthesis as differentiation of atomic and chemical elements, which is now stabilized. The emergence of life is noticed to be a fundamental cosmological events, because it is the inflection point from the deceleration to the acceleration of evolutionary transitions. Furthermore, extrapolating the future of science, we show that the limit of scientific activity is a simulation of an entire universe. We argue that such a simulation can be seen as a blueprint (germ-line) for universe reproduction.

Does Biology Need a New Theory of Explanation?   [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Chetland2010.pdf)  

The problem of how to explain the fundamental nature of organisms for biology commonly falls under two causal systems, mechanistic and teleological. These systems however, fall into fundamental logical problems when put to the test. Many biologists also claim that these systems miss the essential nature of organisms. Historically one of the most important discussions of this problem occurs in Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Judgment, and this work has been chosen as the basis for an investigation of possible ways to avoid the inherent problems that occur with mechanistic and teleological explanations in current biology. By evaluating Kant’s claim, that organisms are not accurately describable by our standard causal explanations, it could be assessed in light of current discoveries whether we have the ability to develop a new causal or acausal system by which to explain organisms. From this analysis, and in agreement with Kant’s investigations of the problems of ‘design-like’ characteristics in organisms, both causal mechanistic and teleological explanations were found to be inapplicable for use in any comprehensive and accurate understanding of organisms and evolution. They are recommended at best to be considered as heuristics. Following this, an investigation of alternate methods of explanation apparently not prone to the problems of mechanistic and teleological causal explanations were characterised and assessed. This lead to the uncovering the system of extremal principles, a system that claims to be acausal and seems to have direct application to fundamental aspects of biology and evolution. This acausal system of extremal principles can for example, be used to describe the class of solitons. Types of solitons (biosolitons) exist in organisms and are important aspects of processes such as morphogenesis, DNA replication, self organization in the cytoskeleton, and locomotion to name a few. They also exhibit the properties of the quantum wave-particle fermions. It is proposed that further investigation of the system of extremal principles and their influence in biology through phenomena such as biosolitons can provide the basis for the development of a new acausal system of explanation or an extra aspect for standard causal models. This, it is concluded, will allow a potential avenue for creating a new and logically more consistent explanatory system in relation to fundamental aspects of the phenomenon of evolution, organisms and the environment.

E = H2O: The Secret Life of Water    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Pollack2010.pdf) 

School children learn that water has three phases: solid, liquid and vapor. But we have recently uncovered what appears to be a fourth phase. This phase occurs next to water-loving (hydrophilic) surfaces. It is surprisingly extensive, projecting out from the surface by up to millions of molecular layers.

Of particular significance is the observation that this fourth phase is charged; and, the water just beyond is oppositely charged, creating a battery that can produce current. We found that light recharges this battery. Thus, water can receive and process electromagnetic energy drawn from the environment — much like plants. The absorbed light energy can then be exploited for performing work, including electrical and mechanical work. Recent experiments confirm the reality of such energy conversion.

The energy-conversion framework implied above seems rich with implication. Not only does it provide an understanding of how water processes solar and other energies, but also it may provide a foundation for simpler understanding natural phenomena ranging from weather and green energy all the way to biological issues such as the origin of life, transport, and osmosis, and energy radiated by water.

The lecture presents evidence for the presence of this novel phase of water, and considers the potentially broad implications of this phase for physics, chemistry and biology.

Introduction to EPI (Extreme Physical Information)    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Frieden2010.pdf)  

Living systems use information and energy to maintain stable entropy in a system that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. However, a quantitative relationship between information and the function and growth of a living system has not yet been developed. We propose a fundamental principle of living systems is that every process of life, including metabolism, signal transduction and protein synthesis, represents a flow of information which, when expressed as Fisher information in particular, is constrained to be either a maximum or minimum. Either extreme state is invariant to first-order perturbation and, hence, maintains stable entropy, as required. Such a state also optimizes intracellular information flow, by the suitable adjustment of the information source and the trajectories of information carriers. This principle has, so far, predicted the (i) observable function and growth characteristics of normal cells or multicellular organisms; the (ii) Lotka-Volterra equations and (iii) power laws of allometry for normal growth. Similarly, it has predicted the (iv) loss of normal function and growth in early cancers, by assuming that carcinogenesis is fundamentally an information “catastrophe” where information regarding cell age and location undergoes transition from a maximum to a minimum state. The minimum leads to a predicted (and confirmed) power-law governing in situ cancer growth in time. (v) It also predicts a program of chemotherapy (termed “adaptive therapy”) that converts the process of cancer mass growth into one of monotonic mass reduction, indicating conversion to a chronic, but manageable, condition.
