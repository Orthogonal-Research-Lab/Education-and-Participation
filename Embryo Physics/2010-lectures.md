Cosmic Embryogenesis  [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Vidal2010.pdf)  

Modern science has shown that there are two trends at play in cosmic evolution. First, a tendency to produce more order, with the emergence of more and more complex systems, from galaxies, stars, planets, to plants, humans and our technological society. Secondly, the second law of thermodynamics applied to the universe as a whole implies that in the far-future the universe will irreversibly go toward a state of maximum disorder. The outcome of those two opposite trends remains unsettled.

Is there a development at play at the cosmological scale? Teilhard de Chardin suggested so when he coined the term “Cosmic Embryogenesis”. We look at nuclear and chemical synthesis as differentiation of atomic and chemical elements, which is now stabilized. The emergence of life is noticed to be a fundamental cosmological events, because it is the inflection point from the deceleration to the acceleration of evolutionary transitions. Furthermore, extrapolating the future of science, we show that the limit of scientific activity is a simulation of an entire universe. We argue that such a simulation can be seen as a blueprint (germ-line) for universe reproduction.

Does Biology Need a New Theory of Explanation?   [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Chetland2010.pdf)  

The problem of how to explain the fundamental nature of organisms for biology commonly falls under two causal systems, mechanistic and teleological. These systems however, fall into fundamental logical problems when put to the test. Many biologists also claim that these systems miss the essential nature of organisms. Historically one of the most important discussions of this problem occurs in Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Judgment, and this work has been chosen as the basis for an investigation of possible ways to avoid the inherent problems that occur with mechanistic and teleological explanations in current biology. By evaluating Kant’s claim, that organisms are not accurately describable by our standard causal explanations, it could be assessed in light of current discoveries whether we have the ability to develop a new causal or acausal system by which to explain organisms. From this analysis, and in agreement with Kant’s investigations of the problems of ‘design-like’ characteristics in organisms, both causal mechanistic and teleological explanations were found to be inapplicable for use in any comprehensive and accurate understanding of organisms and evolution. They are recommended at best to be considered as heuristics. Following this, an investigation of alternate methods of explanation apparently not prone to the problems of mechanistic and teleological causal explanations were characterised and assessed. This lead to the uncovering the system of extremal principles, a system that claims to be acausal and seems to have direct application to fundamental aspects of biology and evolution. This acausal system of extremal principles can for example, be used to describe the class of solitons. Types of solitons (biosolitons) exist in organisms and are important aspects of processes such as morphogenesis, DNA replication, self organization in the cytoskeleton, and locomotion to name a few. They also exhibit the properties of the quantum wave-particle fermions. It is proposed that further investigation of the system of extremal principles and their influence in biology through phenomena such as biosolitons can provide the basis for the development of a new acausal system of explanation or an extra aspect for standard causal models. This, it is concluded, will allow a potential avenue for creating a new and logically more consistent explanatory system in relation to fundamental aspects of the phenomenon of evolution, organisms and the environment.

Chicken galectin-1A and -8 constitute a regulatory network that mediates the earliest steps of avian limb skeletal morphogenesis
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Bhat2010.pdf)

BACKGROUND:
The skeletal elements of vertebrate embryonic limbs are prefigured by rod- and spot-like condensations of precartilage mesenchymal cells. The formation of these condensations depends on cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, but how they are initiated and patterned is as yet unresolved.

RESULTS:
Here we provide evidence that galectins, β-galactoside-binding lectins with β-sandwich folding, play fundamental roles in these processes. We show that among the five chicken galectin (CG) genes, two, CG-1A, and CG-8, are markedly elevated in expression at prospective sites of condensation in vitro and in vivo, with their protein products appearing earlier in development than any previously described marker. The two molecules enhance one another’s gene expression but have opposite effects on condensation formation and cartilage development in vivo and in vitro: CG-1A, a non-covalent homodimer, promotes this process, while the tandem-repeat-type CG-8 antagonizes it. Correspondingly, knockdown of CG-1A inhibits the formation of skeletal elements while knockdown of CG-8 enhances it. The apparent paradox of mutual activation at the gene expression level coupled with antagonistic roles in skeletogenesis is resolved by analysis of the direct effect of the proteins on precartilage cells. Specifically, CG-1A causes their aggregation, whereas CG-8, which has no adhesive function of its own, blocks this effect. The developmental appearance and regulation of the unknown cell surface moieties (“ligands”) to which CG-1A and CG-8 bind were indicative of specific cognate- and cross-regulatory interactions.

CONCLUSION:
Our findings indicate that CG-1A and CG-8 constitute a multiscale network that is a major mediator, earlier-acting than any previously described, of the formation and patterning of precartilage mesenchymal condensations in the developing limb. This network functions autonomously of limb bud signaling centers or other limb bud positional cues.

Stress/Diffusion Dependent Morphogenesis
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Munoz2010.pdf)

A set of equilibrium equations is derived for the stress-controlled shape change of cells due to the remodelling and growth of their internal architecture. The approach involves the decomposition of the deformation gradient into an active and a passive component; the former is allowed to include a growth process, while the latter is assumed to be hyperelastic and mass-preserving. The two components are coupled with a control function that provides the required feedback mechanism. The balance equations for general continua are derived and, using a variational approach, we deduce the equilibrium equations and study the effects of the control function on these equations. The results are applied to a truss system whose function is to simulate the cytoskeletal network constituted by myosin microfilaments and microtubules, which are found experimentally to control shape change in cells. Special attention is paid to the conditions that a thermodynamically consistent formulation should satisfy. The model is used to simulate the multicellular shape changes observed during ventral furrow invagination of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. The results confirm that ventral furrow invagination can be achieved through stress control alone, without the need for other regulatory or signalling mechanisms. The model also reveals that the yolk plays a distinct role in the process, which is different to its role during invagination with externally imposed strains. In stress control, the incompressibility constraint of the yolk leads, via feedback, to the generation of a pressure in the ventral zone of the epithelium that eventually eases its rise and internalisation.

Notes from Barcelona  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/MunozBjoerklundGordon2010.pdf)

These slides correspond to handwritten notes of a meeting during the visit of Richard Gordon and Natalie Björklund in Barcelona, where they met Jose Muñoz. They present in a synthetic manner issues such as the convenience of using tensegrity structures to model the microtubules, microfilaments and lateral filaments of the cytoskeleton. The plausible mechanisms behind the invagination/involution process and the formation of bottle cells in Drosophila embryos, urodeles and salamanders are also discussed. In particular, the hyperestoration hypothesis, the stress control mechanisms, and the diffusion gradients are briefly described and some experiments that may help to decide which of these mechanisms have a higher influence are also mentioned.

Sculptured Thin Films: Nanoengineered Metamaterials  [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Lakhtakia2010.pdf)  

Sculptured thin films (STFs) are assemblies of nanowires that can be fabricated from many different materials, typically via physical vapor deposition onto rotating substrates. The curvilinear–nanowire morphology of STFs is determined by the substrate motions during fabrication. The optical properties, especially, can be tailored by varying the morphology of STFs. In many cases prototype devices have been fabricated for various optical, biological, and other applications.

E = H2O: The Secret Life of Water    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Pollack2010.pdf) 

School children learn that water has three phases: solid, liquid and vapor. But we have recently uncovered what appears to be a fourth phase. This phase occurs next to water-loving (hydrophilic) surfaces. It is surprisingly extensive, projecting out from the surface by up to millions of molecular layers.

Of particular significance is the observation that this fourth phase is charged; and, the water just beyond is oppositely charged, creating a battery that can produce current. We found that light recharges this battery. Thus, water can receive and process electromagnetic energy drawn from the environment — much like plants. The absorbed light energy can then be exploited for performing work, including electrical and mechanical work. Recent experiments confirm the reality of such energy conversion.

The energy-conversion framework implied above seems rich with implication. Not only does it provide an understanding of how water processes solar and other energies, but also it may provide a foundation for simpler understanding natural phenomena ranging from weather and green energy all the way to biological issues such as the origin of life, transport, and osmosis, and energy radiated by water.

The lecture presents evidence for the presence of this novel phase of water, and considers the potentially broad implications of this phase for physics, chemistry and biology.

Experimental biology, evolution, and artificially creating life around 1900: Research and reflections by Jacques Loeb    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Deichmann2010.pdf)  

Dissatisfied with the descriptive and speculative methods of evolutionary biology of his time, the physiologist Jacques Loeb (1859–1924), best known for his “engineering” approach to biology, reflected on the possibilities of artificially creating life in the laboratory. With the objective of experimentally tackling one of the crucial questions of organic evolution, i.e., the origin of life from inanimate matter, he rejected claims made by contemporary scientists of having produced artificial life through osmotic growth processes in inorganic salt solutions. According to Loeb, the answer to the question of whether or not life could be created artificially had to come from macromolecular chemistry, in particular from the research on the recently discovered DNA. He was convinced that a prerequisite for making living matter from inanimate substances was the chemical synthesis of nuclear material capable of selfreplication. Moreover, Loeb, experimentally refuting some vitalistic explanations as well as colloidal chemists’ far-reaching claims that biologically relevant macromolecules follow colloidal rather than chemical laws, pioneered research on the physical and chemical explanations of biological phenomena.

Introduction to EPI (Extreme Physical Information)    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Frieden2010.pdf)  

Living systems use information and energy to maintain stable entropy in a system that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. However, a quantitative relationship between information and the function and growth of a living system has not yet been developed. We propose a fundamental principle of living systems is that every process of life, including metabolism, signal transduction and protein synthesis, represents a flow of information which, when expressed as Fisher information in particular, is constrained to be either a maximum or minimum. Either extreme state is invariant to first-order perturbation and, hence, maintains stable entropy, as required. Such a state also optimizes intracellular information flow, by the suitable adjustment of the information source and the trajectories of information carriers. This principle has, so far, predicted the (i) observable function and growth characteristics of normal cells or multicellular organisms; the (ii) Lotka-Volterra equations and (iii) power laws of allometry for normal growth. Similarly, it has predicted the (iv) loss of normal function and growth in early cancers, by assuming that carcinogenesis is fundamentally an information “catastrophe” where information regarding cell age and location undergoes transition from a maximum to a minimum state. The minimum leads to a predicted (and confirmed) power-law governing in situ cancer growth in time. (v) It also predicts a program of chemotherapy (termed “adaptive therapy”) that converts the process of cancer mass growth into one of monotonic mass reduction, indicating conversion to a chronic, but manageable, condition.

The origin of animal eggs and the ‘embryonic hourglass’: a new (joint) interpretation   [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Newman2010.pdf)  

The evolutionary origin of the egg stage of animal development presents several difficulties for conventional developmental and evolutionary narratives. If the egg’s internal organization represents a template for key features of the developed organism, why can taxa within a given phylum exhibit very different egg types, pass through a common intermediate morphology (the so-called “phylotypic stage”), only to diverge again, thus exemplifying the embryonic “hourglass”? Moreover, if different egg types typically represent adaptations to different environmental conditions, why do birds and mammals, for example, have such vastly different eggs with respect to size, shape, and postfertilization dynamics, whereas all these features are more similar for ascidians and mammals? Here, I consider the possibility that different body plans had their origin in self-organizing physical processes in ancient clusters of cells, and suggest that eggs represented a set of independent evolutionary innovations subsequently inserted into the developmental trajectories of such aggregates. I first describe how “dynamical patterning modules” (DPMs) associations between components of the metazoan developmental-genetic toolkit and certain physical processes and effects may have organized primitive animal body plans independently of an egg stage. Next, I describe how adaptive specialization of cells released from such aggregates could have become “proto-eggs,” which regenerated the parental cell clusters by cleavage, conserving the characteristic DPMs available to a lineage. Then, I show how known processes of cytoplasmic reorganization following fertilization are often based on spontaneous, self-organizing physical effects (“egg-patterning processes”: EPPs). I suggest that rather than acting as developmental blueprints or prepatterns, the EPPs refine the phylotypic body plans determined by the DPMs by setting the boundary and initial conditions under which these multicellular patterning mechanisms operate. Finally, I describe how this new perspective provides a resolution to the embryonic hourglass puzzle.

Chemical Basis for Minimal Cognition    [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/HanczycIkegami2010.pdf)  

We have developed a simple chemical system capable of self-movement in order to study the physicochemical origins of movement. We propose how this system may be useful in the study of minimal perception and cognition. The system consists simply of an oil droplet in an aqueous environment. A chemical reaction within the oil droplet induces an instability, the symmetry of the oil droplet breaks, and the droplet begins to move through the aqueous phase. The complement of physical phenomena that is then generated indicates the presence of feedback cycles that, as will be argued, form the basis for self-regulation, homeostasis, and perhaps an extended form of autopoiesis. We discuss the result that simple chemical systems are capable of sensory-motor coupling and possess a homeodynamic state from which cognitive processes may emerge.
