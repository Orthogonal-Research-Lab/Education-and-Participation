A Pattern Language for Animal Form [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Newman2009.pdf) [related blogpost](http://embryogenesisexplained.rudnyi.ru/2010/11/the-origin-of-animal-eggs.html)

This talk considers the role played by a core set of “dynamical patterning modules” (DPMs) in the origination, development and evolution of complex organisms. These consist of the products of a subset of the genes of what has come to be known as the “developmental-genetic toolkit” in association with physical processes they mobilize. The physical processes are those characteristic of chemically and mechanically excitable mesoscopic systems like cell aggregates: cohesion, viscoelasticity, diffusion, spatiotemporal heterogeneity based on activator-inhibitor interaction, and multistable and oscillatory dynamics. We focus on the emergence of the Metazoa, and show how toolkit gene products and pathways that pre-existed the metazoans acquired novel morphogenetic functions simply by virtue of the change in scale and context inherent to multicellularity. We propose that DPMs, acting singly and in combination with each other, constitute a “pattern language” capable of generating all metazoan body plans and organ forms. This concept implies that the multicellular organisms of the late Precambrian-early Cambrian were phenotypically plastic, fluently exploring morphospace in a fashion decoupled from both function-based selection and genotypic change. The relatively stable developmental trajectories and morphological phenotypes of modern organisms, then, are considered to be products of stabilizing selection. This perspective solves the apparent “molecular homology-analogy paradox,” whereby widely divergent modern animal types utilize the same molecular toolkit during development, but it does so by inverting the neo-Darwinian principle that phenotypic disparity was generated over long periods of time in concert with, and in proportion to genotypic change.

Mechanics of Soft Matter: Application to Evo-Devo [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Levin2009.pdf)

Biologic material must be classified as “soft matter”, the same material category as colloids, foams and gels. The mechanics of foams and similar soft matter are different from the mechanics of solid, liquid and gases. They follow rigid rules formulated by Joseph Plateau in the mid 19^th century, and these rules must apply to biologic cells and sub-cellular structures, most of which are colloids. Here we will explore how these physical laws might affect evolutionary development of the embryo.

The Virtual World: A 21st Century Medium for: I. CyberSpace, II. StreetSpace, III. OuterSpace, and IV. BioSpace [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Damer2009.pdf)

The rise of the digital age in the last quarter of the 20th Century birthed a new medium for the 21st: the virtual world. Human presence in digital spaces evolved first from a single spot on the screen of the PDP-1 computer in the 1962 game Spacewar  through a series of graphical and textual worlds of the 1970s (Maze War, Videoplace, MUDS and other online environments), the 1980s (Habitat, Virtual Reality), the 1990s (avatar worlds, early Internet games and identities) and the 2000s where millions of users have presence in multiple overlapping virtual worlds (MMOs, social virtual worlds, social networks, wireless communities).

Virtual worlds pioneer Bruce Damer will present a forty year overview of the virtual world as an emerging medium of human presence and then project forward another few decades with his best guess at how this presence will extend from inside CyberSpace out to StreetSpace, into OuterSpace and finally, up to BioSpace. He will illustrate this vision with his and others’ work in online virtual environments, wearable sensored computing tied to online identity, the simulation of living systems, evolution and the quest for the origin of life, and the use of virtual worlds to design new NASA missions throughout the solar system.

Effects of Microgravity on Cell Cytoskeleton and Embryogenesis [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Crawford-Young2009.pdf)

The aim of this review is to compile, summarize and discuss the effects of microgravity on embryos, cell structure and function that have been demonstrated from data obtained during experiments performed in space or in altered gravity induced by clinostats. In cells and tissues cellular structure and genetic expression may be changed in microgravity and this has a variety of effects on embryogenesis which include death of the embryo, failure of neural tube closure, or final deformities to the overall morphology of the newborn or hatchling. Many species and protocols have been used for microgravity space experiments making it difficult to compare results. Experiments on the ways in which embryonic development and cell interactions occur in microgravity could also be performed. Experiments that have been done with cells in microgravity show changes in morphology, cytoskeleton and function. Changes in cytoskeleton have been noted and studies on microtubules in gravity have shown that they are gravity sensitive. Further study of basic chemical reactions that occur in cells should be done to shed some light on the underling processes leading to the changes that are observed in cells and embryos in microgravity.
