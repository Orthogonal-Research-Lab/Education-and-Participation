A cytoskeletal structure (the cell state splitter) at the apical end of epithelial cells, that we predicted [1] and observed [2], may be set up in a metastable state and explain the binary nature of cell differentiations due to its predicted bistability. A differentiation wave is a propagation of expansion or contraction of a cell’s cell state splitter to cell state splitters in adjacent cells. For example, a contraction differentiation wave was predicted in 1985 [1] as being what conveys planar induction of the neural plate in urodele amphibians (salamanders and newts) from cell to cell in the ectoderm. This wave was found in axolotl embryos in 1990 [3, 4], and proved easy to observe [5]. Signal transduction from the cell state splitter to the nucleus need only involve transmission of one bit of information: whether the cell has just participated in a contraction (0) or expansion (1) differentiation wave. The signal presumably triggers one of two gene cascades, depending on whether the wave was a contraction or an expansion wave, changing the cell’s phenotype. The history of bits for a given cell is its differentiation code [6]. Numerous other paired expansion and contraction waves with complementary trajectories, that correlate with classically defined steps of differentiation [6, 7], suggest that the “genetic program” for embryogenesis consists of a bifurcating alternation of differentiation waves and specific gene expression triggered by the waves. The genetic program can be represented as a bifurcating differentiation tree, in which the differentiation waves become the modules of development [8]. The nucleus is postulated to be a finite state machine that responds to the signal from the cell state splitter by changing its configuration to one of two new accessible states. A ratcheting mechanism would prevent return to a previous state. This can be approximated by a toy model, the Wurfel [9]. Mosaic development can be addressed by postulating single cell differentiation waves  [4]. Application of these concepts to the origin [10] and differentiation [11, 12] of stem cells will be left for Lu Kai’s talk. Differentiation waves provide a working model for solving “…the grand problem of biology, how out of a single cell arises the complex multicellular organism” [13]. Outstanding problems include the mechanisms for triggering and halting differentiation waves [4, 14], the relationships of differentiation waves to the mechanics of embryogenesis [14], to birth defects [15], to molecular developmental biology [4], to the logical, chromosomal and synteny organization of the genome [4], to tissue-specific drug development, and to macroevolution, microevolution and progressive evolution [4]. The origin of differentiation waves may be interwoven with the origin of life [16].

Geometric locations of differentiated cells in sponges are totally unrelated to spatial signals to differentiate

Sponge cells constantly rearrange, just as much from one day to the next as when their cells are mechanically separated from each other. H. V. Wilson discovered the ability of sponge and coral cells to rearrange into normal patterns. Calhoun Bond and Albert Harris discovered the constant rearrangement phenomenon, while making time lapse videos of sponges living in the equivalent of “ant farms”, i.e. between parallel glass slides. Their mesenchymal cells move the fastest, which is twice a cell length per minute. Extracellular skeletal rods (“spicules”, made of silicon oxide) are temporarily assembled into the mechanical equivalents of tent poles, and glued together with collagen. Within a few days or hours, spicules are detached from each other and carried to new locations for reassembly. Special kinds of epithelial cells, which lack basal membranes, form the outside surfaces of sponges, and also internal canals through which water is pumped out by flagellated cells called choanocytes, which pull water between each other, as occurs in nephridial kidneys of many phyla. By looking only at dead, fixed sections through sponges, textbooks and specialists have misinterpreted nearly every aspect of their anatomy, which leaves many opportunities for biophysical research to determine which properties of individual cells cause continual reformation of their same histological patterns.
