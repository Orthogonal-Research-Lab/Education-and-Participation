Introduction to differentiation waves. Part 1  
[Slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Gordon2013a.pdf), [References](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Reference%20Lists/Gordon-2013.md)

A cytoskeletal structure (the cell state splitter) at the apical end of epithelial cells, that we predicted [1] and observed [2], may be set up in a metastable state and explain the binary nature of cell differentiations due to its predicted bistability. A differentiation wave is a propagation of expansion or contraction of a cell’s cell state splitter to cell state splitters in adjacent cells. For example, a contraction differentiation wave was predicted in 1985 [1] as being what conveys planar induction of the neural plate in urodele amphibians (salamanders and newts) from cell to cell in the ectoderm. This wave was found in axolotl embryos in 1990 [3, 4], and proved easy to observe [5]. Signal transduction from the cell state splitter to the nucleus need only involve transmission of one bit of information: whether the cell has just participated in a contraction (0) or expansion (1) differentiation wave. The signal presumably triggers one of two gene cascades, depending on whether the wave was a contraction or an expansion wave, changing the cell’s phenotype. The history of bits for a given cell is its differentiation code [6]. Numerous other paired expansion and contraction waves with complementary trajectories, that correlate with classically defined steps of differentiation [6, 7], suggest that the “genetic program” for embryogenesis consists of a bifurcating alternation of differentiation waves and specific gene expression triggered by the waves. The genetic program can be represented as a bifurcating differentiation tree, in which the differentiation waves become the modules of development [8]. The nucleus is postulated to be a finite state machine that responds to the signal from the cell state splitter by changing its configuration to one of two new accessible states. A ratcheting mechanism would prevent return to a previous state. This can be approximated by a toy model, the Wurfel [9]. Mosaic development can be addressed by postulating single cell differentiation waves  [4]. Application of these concepts to the origin [10] and differentiation [11, 12] of stem cells will be left for Lu Kai’s talk. Differentiation waves provide a working model for solving “…the grand problem of biology, how out of a single cell arises the complex multicellular organism” [13]. Outstanding problems include the mechanisms for triggering and halting differentiation waves [4, 14], the relationships of differentiation waves to the mechanics of embryogenesis [14], to birth defects [15], to molecular developmental biology [4], to the logical, chromosomal and synteny organization of the genome [4], to tissue-specific drug development, and to macroevolution, microevolution and progressive evolution [4]. The origin of differentiation waves may be interwoven with the origin of life [16].

Geometric locations of differentiated cells in sponges are totally unrelated to spatial signals to differentiate

Sponge cells constantly rearrange, just as much from one day to the next as when their cells are mechanically separated from each other. H. V. Wilson discovered the ability of sponge and coral cells to rearrange into normal patterns. Calhoun Bond and Albert Harris discovered the constant rearrangement phenomenon, while making time lapse videos of sponges living in the equivalent of “ant farms”, i.e. between parallel glass slides. Their mesenchymal cells move the fastest, which is twice a cell length per minute. Extracellular skeletal rods (“spicules”, made of silicon oxide) are temporarily assembled into the mechanical equivalents of tent poles, and glued together with collagen. Within a few days or hours, spicules are detached from each other and carried to new locations for reassembly. Special kinds of epithelial cells, which lack basal membranes, form the outside surfaces of sponges, and also internal canals through which water is pumped out by flagellated cells called choanocytes, which pull water between each other, as occurs in nephridial kidneys of many phyla. By looking only at dead, fixed sections through sponges, textbooks and specialists have misinterpreted nearly every aspect of their anatomy, which leaves many opportunities for biophysical research to determine which properties of individual cells cause continual reformation of their same histological patterns.

The mistaken Differential Adhesion Hypothesis  
[Slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Harris2013b.pdf), [References](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Reference%20Lists/Harris-DAH.md)  

Malcolm Steinberg invented the “Differential Adhesion Hypothesis” (Steinberg 1963, 1970).  His key idea was that aggregations of cells are thermodynamically equivalent to drops of liquids, and that maximization of adhesions between cells acts like maximization of molecule-to-molecule contact.  He proposed that this is the reason why aggregations of cells behave as if they have contractile surfaces.  Albert Harris (1976) published a critique suggesting an alternative explanation – namely that cell aggregates really do have contractile surfaces, caused by strengthened  acto-myosin contraction of those parts of individual cell surfaces that are not touching other cells.  Steinberg had tested his theory by combining chemically dissociated cells from seven cell types, in pair-wise combinations.  His theory predicted that if cell type A sorted out to a more interior position relative to cell type B, and if cell type B sorted out to an interior position relative to cell type C, then A would always sort out to an interior position relative to C.  He called this “Transitivity”.  The logic was that if A is more adhesive than B, and if B is more adhesive than C, then A would have to be more adhesive than C.  The Harris critique was that transitivity is predicted equally by any hypotheses based on quantitative variables. For example, if A is stronger than B, etc.  In terms of the small field of Mathematics called “relation theory”, the sorting behavior of dissociated cells is a “partial order relation”. Theories based on time sequence would make the same prediction:  If A happens after B, and B happens after C, then A must happen after C.  Therefore Adam Curtis’ “Timing” explanation for sorting (Curtis, 1961) also predicted transitivity.

In collaboration with Herbert Phillips, Steinberg measured the resistance of cell aggregates to flattening by centrifugation and by direct pressure (Phillips et al., 1977; Phillips and Steinberg, 1978).  They proved that the greater the resistance to flattening, the more interior the relative location of sorting out.  Harris argued that the identical prediction is made by explanations of cell rounding by active contraction.  Steinberg was not persuaded, and he and Phillips quantified resistances to flattening as “Reversible Work of Adhesion” and invoked the fearsome and unfathomable mysteries of thermodynamics in opposition to Harris. Unfortunately, that person had taken multiple college courses in thermodynamics (as a way to hang out with his girl-friend) not to mention being a veteran debater in public controversies about when thermodynamics does and doesn’t apply to biological phenomena.

By the early 1980s, many cell-cell adhesion proteins had been discovered, including N-CAM and L-CAM by Edelman et al. (1983) and many different cadherins by Takeichi (1988).  That reduced the need for Steinberg’s explanation by differences in amount of just one kind of adhesion protein.  It also created a paradox: why do relative positions behave as if caused by a differences in an amount of some quantitative variable, given that cell-cell adhesion proteins differ in kind, not just amount?

Harris’ answer was that cadherins, etc. cause like cells to bunch together, and that differences in amount of contractile strength is what produces the inside-versus-outside positions, and likewise that contractile strength is what was measured by the resistance to flattening measurements of Phillips.  Wayne Brodland (Brodland, 2002; http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/brodland/) used computer simulations to produce a better version of this reasoning.

Steinberg later spent a sabbatical with Takiechi, doing molecular biology (Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994). They used tissue culture  cells from an established mouse line, that happened to lack genes for any cell-cell adhesion proteins.  Into the chromosomes of these non-adhesive cells, they inserted (“transformed”) multiple copies of the a gene for cadherin (some had 2 copies per cell, some had 4 copies, etc.)  They then mixed single-cell suspensions of their transformed lines. As hoped, those cells with the most copies of the cadherin gene sorted out to the more internal position.  No attempt was made to compare their strengths of contractility.  Prof. Steinberg regarded this as the final, undisputable confirmation of his theory.  C-P Heisenberg (Puech et al., 2005; Krieg et al., 2008) and collaborators used Zebra-fish embryos and Atomic Force Microscopy to compare forces needed  to pull cells apart, versus forces needed to flatten cell aggregates.  P. B. Green’s lucid review of their findings concluded that Brodland and Harris’ interpretation may replace Steinberg’s in textbooks (Green, 2008). This has yet to happen.

Steinberg and Harris remained lifelong friends: agreeing to disagree. They both believed that cell sorting is caused by the same forces that cause gastrulation, neurulation, and other normal rearrangements embryonic movement. They also agreed that many cancer cells differ from normal equivalents in the same properties that cause sorting out to external positions (Foty and Steinberg, 2004; Danowski and Harris, 1988). Too bad they couldn’t reach agreement, and that thermodynamics gets a reputation as a mystery-weapon for repulsion of logic.  It’s a fallacy that only conservative (reversible) forces  (i.e. that don’t continually expend energy) can cause cells to gravitate to consistent end results, by multiple series of intermediate geometries.  Body cells crawl actively, somewhat  like amoebae; they pull themselves toward and past adhesions; they are not  passively pulled around by forces of attraction toward glass, collagen etc.  Passive pulling was advocated  vigorously by Paul Weiss (1961) and Stephen Carter (1967,1970). Proponents of “Differential Adhesion” don’t realize that their calculations of “Reversible Work of Adhesion” are not valid except if cells are passively pulled by enlargement of cell-cell adhesions.

This misbegotten enterprise is being carried forward by Professor Ramsey Foty (Foty and Steinberg, 2005).  Both sides ought to give more consideration to the possibility that the other has some truth on their side, lest they give stubbornness a bad name.

From a larger perspective, I believe that Steinberg’s theory, although misguided in details, was ahead of its time, aimed in the right direction, and closer to the truth than most of his critics:

1) Steinberg was right to believe that cell sorting is caused by combinations of physical properties of individual cells.

2) Steinberg and Holtfreter were both right that these same properties of cells also cause embryos to gastrulate, to neurulate, and to rearrange themselves to form many organs of the body, possibly all organs.

3) Steinberg and Phillips were correct that one particular quantitative variable causes the inside/outside location of cell types, when they sort out, and also exerts the driving force that causes aggregations of cells to round up, and to resist flattening.

Never mind that acto-myosin driven contractility is this key variable, not amounts of cell-cell adhesiveness.

4) Even more profoundly, Steinberg and Phillips were also on the right track to envision that anatomical shapes and arrangements are caused by counterbalances of forces.

Regarding their misunderstanding of thermodynamics, especially their belief that cellular forces correspond to “reversible works of adhesion”: They are right that counterbalance is what matters;  But active forces are just as much able to be counterbalanced, either against one another or against “conservative” (equals “reversible”) forces, like elastic stretching.  If they exist, works of adhesion could be reversible, and measurable. Thermodynamics is like some electric saw: when used correctly; very powerful; but if you don’t read the instructions carefully enough, look out!

Stephen Levin in the US (Levin, 2002; http://www.biotensegrity.com/), and Lev Beloussov in Moscow (Beloussov, 2012) have come closest to the truth in regarding mechanical stabilities of organs in terms of what Fuller and Ingber (Ingber, 1997) called tensegrity structures.  To achieve geometric stability, it is sufficient (and, I believe, necessary) to have pairs of opposed forces that are counterbalanced (equal in strength: opposite in direction) only when a certain shape exists.  One or both of the counterbalanced forces need to vary as some mathematical function of the currently existing shape.  All imbalances need to be back toward stable balance. This is an example of what Otter and colleagues (Andersen et al., 2009)  call “Shape Homeostasis”.  Active feedback controls are prone to over-correct, which I suggest is at least part of the Hyper-Restoration phenomenon, discovered by Lev Beloussov, who showed that it causes important embryonic cell rearrangements.

Therefore, I regard Steinberg, Phillips and Foty as having been 90% correct, analogous to following instructions to someone’s house, getting 9 out of 10 turns correct, but unfortunately turning left instead of right at one of the early turns. We need to sort this out.

Nanobioconvergence  
[Slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Gebeshuber2013.pdf)    

One of the fascinating aspects of nanotechnology is that on the nanometer scale all the natural sciences meet and intertwine. Physics meets life sciences as well as engineering, chemistry, materials science, tribology and computational approaches, which altogether communicate and are closely linked. The methods, concepts and goals of the respective fields converge. This inherent interdisciplinarity of nanotechnology poses a challenge and offers an enormous potential for fruitful cross-fertilization in specialist areas. Nanobioconvergence denotes the merging of life sciences, especially biology and bionanotechnology, with nanoscience and nanotechnology, focusing on the technical connection of these particular technologies as well as on the unified opportunities and challenges they present to human nature and our values. Nanobioconvergent technologies are most useful when applied to specific problems where innovative solutions can be provided through leveraging varieties of technologies.

The emergence of nanobioconvergence happens in an atmosphere of dissolution of the strict borders between classical disciplines. New findings in the natural sciences and the development of new technologies enhance the possibilities and range of interference with matter in general.

New observation tools such as the atomic force microscope allow for investigation of matter on an ever-decreasing length scale. Biomolecules can be investigated in action. The new tools and methods also allow for manipulation on the scale of nanometers. Engineering at the molecular level, tailoring new structures and materials, even building of machine-like devices at this scale is increasingly becoming possible. The basis for such technological applications is the knowledge revealed in the biosciences as well as in nanoscience. Similar themes are now approached from different perspectives and disciplines, resulting in a fruitful exchange of concepts, methods and tools. As the tools of investigation can also be used for manipulation and generation of structures, new areas of application are attracting interest from manufacturers.

Bionanoscience focuses on the molecular building blocks of living cells. Nanotechnology enables the study and control of biomolecules, delivering new insights into surface properties as well as into the working of biological cells themselves. Nanobioconvergence potentially will revolutionize our understanding and practice of medicine. The integration of new molecules into cells allows for extended manipulation of cellular functions, such as gene regulation. These new possibilities are further investigated in the emerging new field of synthetic biology.

In manipulating the building blocks of matter, nanobioconvergence has implications on various areas – including health, environmental and social issues. Therefore, prospects, problems and potential risks are an important issue. Technological, environmental, societal, health, and safety issues must be addressed in research, societal studies, regulatory measures, and government policies. Societal implications of converging technologies should be judged using a balanced approach between the goals (leading to envisioned societal benefits) and unexpected consequences (which could be a combination of unexpected benefits and risks).

Waddington redux: simple abstract models and integrative biological explanations  
[Slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Fagan2013.pdf)   

The epigenetic landscape is a model of development, originally proposed by C. H. Waddington to visually explicate an integrated theory of genetics, development and evolution.  This simple, evocative model represents development as an undulating surface of hills and valleys.  Today, updated versions of Waddington’s landscape play significant, though distinct, roles in stem cell research and systems biology.  Both fields offer new and fruitful approaches to studying biological development.  But it is not clear how they should relate.  In stem cell biology, the predominant method is experimental manipulation of concrete cells and tissues.  Systems biology, in contrast, emphasizes mathematical modeling of cellular systems.  I argue that Waddington’s landscape model can help coordinate stem cell and systems approaches to yield integrated, ‘mechanistic’ explanations of cell development.  In this way, Waddington’s landscape can play an updated unificatory role.  I examine this model’s structure, representational assumptions, and uses in all three contexts, and argue that explanations of cell development require both mathematical models and concrete experiments.  On this view, the two approaches are interdependent, with mathematical models playing a crucial but circumscribed role in explanations of cell development.

The Physics of Cell Fate Branching: A Swedish Flag Model  
[Slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Harris2013c.pdf)     

Two central puzzles of embryology are: (first) how cell differentiation is controlled such that nerve cells each develop at their correct locations, relative to skin cells, skeleton etc. And (second) how this control mechanism compensates for changes in volume, over as much as a 16-fold range. The latter ability was discovered in 1895 by Hans Driesch, and raises huge, unresolved questions, on the scale of Relativity. Currently, the most popular explanation is Lewis Wolpert’s concept of “Positional Information” which he presents as “The French Flag Model”. This metaphor uses a diffusion gradient to control differentiation into red, white and blue cell types.

A very different explanation (Richard Gordon and Natalie Björklund) is that contraction waves in embryos govern “Cell-State-Splitters”, with bending of cell sheets controlling what cell type they become. As a parallel to Wolpert’s French flag (and being myself partly Swedish in ancestry), I use the geometry of the Swedish flag to explore how bending of sheets can generate patterns that are just as much able to adjust relative dimensions over an unlimited range of absolute sizes, thus accounting for Driesch’s Phenomenon.
