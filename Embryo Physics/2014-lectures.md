Biotensegrity: Bioarchitecture & Dynamic Anatomy  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Levin2014.pdf)  

Embryologic development, from ‘origin of life’ to organism, has been regarded by scientists as a series of chance occurrences, the “Blind Watchmaker” theory popularized by Richard Dawkins, “a universe without design”. What is argued in this talk is that the laws of physics as applied to structures must play a dominant, and often deciding, role in organism structure and evolution. Structural stability of the developing organism becomes a driving force and adherence to physical laws makes much of emergence “deterministic”. Only certain forms are acceptable and physical laws must be followed. A newly developing embryo will always cede to stable configuration rather than an unstable one, and to a lesser energy form rather than to a higher energy consuming form. The underlying structural ‘design’ features from viruses to vertebrae, their systems and sub-systems, are remarkably similar. ‘Chance’ is only relative and whatever emerges can do so only by following physical Laws. To quote D’Arcy Thompson,”Cell and tissue, shell and bone, leaf and flower, are so many portions of matter, and it is in obedience to the laws of physics that their particles have been moved, moulded and conformed.” We introduce the concept of “tensegrity” as the underlying mechanical structural organization that holds it all together.

Experimental and computational methods for identifying genetic variants impact on gene regulation  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Pique-Regi2014)  

In this talk I will present novel computational methods for identifying regulatory sequences and for modeling the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription control. The objective is to get better maps of tissue / cell-condition specific regulatory regions of the genome. The methods are also useful for characterizing variation across individuals and to obtain a better understanding of the impact of genetic variation on the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription regulation, and on complex traits. Our results indicate that disruption of protein binding to DNA as measured by DNaseI footprinting is a major mechanism underlying genetic variants that are associated with changes in gene expression. We expect that these genetic variants are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.

Mechanisms of Embryonic Wound Healing: Experiment and Modeling  [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Wyczalkowski2014.pdf)  videos [1](http://youtu.be/8_IlnLw2aSI), [2](http://youtu.be/8_IlnLw2aSI), [3](http://youtu.be/r8FBmNXZleQ), [4](http://youtu.be/S9dbo0GjA1w), [5](http://youtu.be/McAa-5EwJJI), [6](http://youtu.be/CI85BTvHdPQ), [7](http://youtu.be/U8Y5NNZSjtQ), [8](http://youtu.be/OC3vx5sgEg4), [9](http://youtu.be/IPPSXxJW_Bk), [10](http://youtu.be/2UKQaVG-MNA)

The healing of embryonic wounds yields insight into mechanical forces which shape a developing organism. Here we characterize healing of wounds in epithelia of early stage chick embryos, and use a newly developed computational model to investigate underlying cellular-level mechanisms. Early stage chick embryos, consisting of planar epithelial sheets two to three cell layers thick, were harvested and cultured ex ovo. Multicellular wounds were made and allowed to heal. We found that the closure rate of embryonic wounds displayed a two-phase behavior, with rapid constriction lasting about a minute, followed by more gradual contraction until the wound closed. Fluorescent staining revealed that soon after wounding a broad, faint ring of contractile actin and myosin-II encircles the wound. By one minute post wounding this structure gives way to a narrow actomyosin band at the wound border, consistent with a “purse string” healing mechanism observed in other embryonic systems. We hypothesize that contraction of the broad ring is responsible for the initial, rapid phase of wound closure, and that the narrow purse string drives the later slower phase. To test these mechanisms, we implemented both in a finite element computational model. We found that the rapid initial phase of wound closure is consistent only with an isotropic contraction of the broad ring surrounding the wound, and that the slower phase can be accounted for by the formation and circumferential contraction of fibers at the wound margin. Together, these two mechanisms can quantitatively reproduce the observed wound healing dynamics. The results of this integrated experimental and computational investigation suggest that a new mechanism, the isotropic contraction of cells in a broad ring around the wound, works together with an actomyosin contractile ring to close an embryonic wound.

Designing Complex Dynamics with Memory: Elementary Cellular Automata Case  [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Martinez2014.pdf), [previous talk](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Martinez2010.pdf)

Since their inception at Macy conferences in later 1940s complex systems remain the most controversial topic of inter-disciplinary sciences. The term complex system is the most vague and liberally used scientific term. Using elementary cellular automata (ECA), and exploiting the CA classification, we demonstrate elusiveness of complexity by shifting space-time dynamics of the automata from simple to complex by enriching cells with memory. This way, we can transform any ECA class to another ECA class — without changing skeleton of cell-state transition function — and vice versa by just selecting a right kind of memory. A systematic analysis display that memory helps discover hidden information and behaviour on trivial — uniform, periodic, and non-trivial — chaotic, complex — dynamical systems.

Nuclear and chromatin architecture changes accompanying differentiation

Pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is thought to contain two states. The  pluripotent ground state, characterised by high levels of bi-allelic expression of the nanog  gene, and the primed state, where Nanog levels are comparatively lower and low expression of early differentiation markers for all germs layers can be detected. The subsequent state involves commitment to a particular lineage, upregulating the requisite genes to promote that programme, while downregulating pluripotency genes. In keeping with these three states, ESCs undergo changes in mechanical properties, vis a vis a changes in overall nuclear deformation and chromatin mobility. The naïve ground state is characterised by stiff, non-deformable nuclei, that soften and become quite deformable, both at the level of the whole nucleus, as well as in terms of chromatin mobility, in the primed state. Whereas these pluripotent stages are characterised by lamina containing only A-type lamins, upon differentiation, A-type lamins are expressed. As primed nuclei transition to differentiation, they begin to express A-type lamins and become more stiff, though not necessarily as stiff as in the ground state. The mobile nature of the chromatin is also lost with differentiation, as cells of more limited developmental capacity (neural stem cells, NSCs, and embryonic fibroblasts) have less mobile chromatin, preserving the 3D relationships between adjacent chromosome territories, the chromosome neighbourhoods, were preserved with differentiation. While the stiffness of the nucleus is heavily affected by A-type lamin constituents of the lamina, other factors such as the level of chromatin condensation can severely augment the  mechanical properties of nuclei.

Biochemical and mechanical regulation of extracellular matrix signaling: insights from fibronectin  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Smith2014.pdf) 

A growing trend in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is to view cells, matrices and whole tissues from a materials science perspective. The rationale behind this novel approach to considering biological problems is that the material properties at these different length scales both define their physical stability and also provide instructive cues. These instructive cues can maintain homeostasis in healthy tissues or drive dynamic events during development, wound healing, and disease progression. This lecture will discuss how the extracellular matrix presents these instructive cues to cells, and also how cells regulate these instructive cues through biochemical and mechanical approaches.

4D-Genomics: The genome dynamics and constraint in biology  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Heng2014.pdf)

Genetics and evolution represent two of the most important scientific disciplines and hold significant roles in the foundation of current biology.  To date, however, most molecular understanding of these subjects is based on gene-centric concepts, leading to many obvious paradoxes.  To address these issues, a genome based framework is urgently needed that can appropriately define system inheritance and illustrate the patterns of evolutionary dynamics and constraint.  In this presentation, the concept of 4D-Genomics will be introduced as a new framework based on the genome theory of cancer and organismal evolution.  In particular, the following questions will be briefly discussed through the lens of genome based evolutionary theory:  How do karyotypes, rather than specific genes, define the system or species?  What are the two phases of cancer evolution (Punctuated and Darwinian stepwise)?  What is the main function of sex and how is system inheritance defined and maintained?  What is the relationship between gene defined microevolution and genome defined macroevolution?  Finally, what is the importance of separating germ line and somatic cells?

Imprinting of body functions during critical developmental periods  
[reference list](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Tzschentke2014ref.pdf), [slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Tzschentke2014.pdf)

‘Imprinting’ describes a fundamental process of life, which occurs during limited periods of fetal (in birds embryonic) development and early phases of life. It has long-lasting effects and may be even passed on the succeeding generations in an epigenetic fashion. In his classical studies on newly hatched goslings, Konrad Lorenz (1935) analysed the development of social binding, applying the term ‘imprinting’ to describe this process. One of his major hypotheses was that ‘imprinting’ occurs during limited and severely restricted critical periods in early life. Later in 1974/1975, Günter Dörner, a pioneering developmental neuroendocrinologist, developed a general origination concept of the epigenetic perinatal programming of the lifetime function of fundamental regulatory systems. Hormones as well as neurotransmitters and cytotokines (as immune cell hormones) play a key role in this concept. They act as critical endogenous effectors, which transmit environmental information to the genome. Ultimately, they too are acting as epigenetic factors. ‘Imprinting’ of regulatory systems is probably realized at the microstructural level in the brain (e.g. in terms of synaptic plasticity), as well as by lasting, environment-induced (epigenetic) modification of the genome.

Because of its independent development from the mother, the bird embryo provides an excellent model for investigations of pre- and perinatal ‘imprinting’ of body functions. It allows high standardized and controlled changes in epigenetic (environmental) factors during different time windows of early development.

In the avian embryo, during final incubation the development of feedback mechanisms of physiological control systems is a ‘critical period’ and therefore sensitive to ‘imprinting’. During this ‘critical period’, the actual level at which physiological parameters are active may pre-determine a life-long ‘set point’ (or ‘set ranges’) for the respective physiological control system.

On the one hand, chronic cold or warm load during the last days of incubation may adapt birds to the expected post-hatching environmental conditions by imprinting of the thermoregulatory system (prenatal epigenetic temperature adaptation). Phenotypic changes occur, which are typical for cold or warm adaptation. On the other hand, perinatal short-term temperature stimulation (“temperature training”) improves robustness of the birds. Because of the integrating role of the thermoregulatory system, it is worth considering that may also induce ‘imprinting’ of other body functions: metabolism, feed intake and body weight, immune system and behaviour, for example.

‘Imprinting’ of body functions under suboptimal environmental conditions could be a basis for the perinatal malprogramming of body functions, producing e.g., metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases as well as behavioural disorders during later life. It is known from studies in humans (e.g. development of obesity due to gestational maternal diabetes) as well as in poultry (e.g. development of Acites syndrome due to suboptimum incubation conditions).

Traction and stress microscopy for cells: the wound healing case  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/VitoConte2014.pdf)

A fundamental feature of multicellular organisms is their ability to self-repair wounds through the movement of epithelial cells into the damaged area1,2. This collective cellular movement is commonly attributed to a combination of cell crawling and “purse-string” contraction of a supracellular actomyosin ring3-4. Here we show by direct experimental measurement combining traction and stress microscopy that these two mechanisms are insufficient to explain force patterns observed during wound closure. Contrary to common assumptions, we found that actin and myosin accumulate at the leading edge in a heterogeneous mechanical structure that transmits part of its tension to the underlying substrate through focal adhesions. The orientation of these adhesions and the traction forces they transmit are mainly parallel to the wound edge and thus perpendicular to the direction of cell motion. This structural and mechanical organization provides cells with an unanticipated mechanism to close the wound by cooperatively compressing the underlying substrate.

As an undergraduate at Michigan State University, I studied microbial genetics and quickly became enamored with the complexity of it all, from evolution to regulation. I also developed an interest in programming, and began working on projects that combined the two fields. When applying to PhD programs, I decided to focus my interests on human genetics and decided on Wayne State University’s Center of Molecular Medicine and Genetics for it’s translational focus. Currently I am a second-year PhD student working under Roger Pique-Regi and Francesca Luca, studying the impact of non-coding variation on gene expression and phenotype.
