Modelling active cell processes in multicellular sheets  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/TimothyNewman2011.pdf)

Early stages of metazoan embryogenesis require large-scale topological and morphological transitions, involving hundreds or thousands of cells. A central aim of developmental biology is to understand and quantify the underlying mechanisms driving and regulating these transitions. A particular challenge is to understand the relative roles of genetic regulation and emergence, which, crudely speaking, reflect the biological and physical aspects of the process. In this talk I will describe our efforts to construct an agent-based computer algorithm, the Subcellular Element Model (ScEM), which allows simulation of large three-dimensional multicellular systems, and the implementation of physical and biological mechanisms. In particular, the ScEM naturally accommodates cell shape deformations and biomechanics, upon which can be layered cell biological processes such as cell growth and division. I will focus on recent advances in our group in which the ScEM has been used to model active cell processes. I will show how such processes, at the micron scale, lead to emergent fluid-like properties of embryonic epithelia, with effective tissue viscosities in agreement with experimental data. I will also describe the application of this model to primitive streak formation in the chick embryo, and show how our model was used to test a recent hypothesis that chemotaxis is the underlying driver.

Bionanoconvergence  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Gebeshuber2012.pdf)

One of the fascinating aspects of nanotechnology is that on the nanometer scale all the natural sciences meet and intertwine. Physics meets life sciences as well as engineering, chemistry, materials science, tribology and computational approaches, which altogether communicate and are closely linked. The methods, concepts and goals of the respective fields converge. This inherent interdisciplinarity of nanotechnology poses a challenge and offers an enormous potential for fruitful cross-fertilization in specialist areas. Nanobioconvergence denotes the merging of life sciences, especially biology and bionanotechnology, with nanoscience and nanotechnology, focusing on the technical connection of these particular technologies as well as on the unified opportunities and challenges they present to human nature and our values. Nanobioconvergent technologies are most useful when applied to specific problems where innovative solutions can be provided through leveraging varieties of technologies.

The emergence of nanobioconvergence happens in an atmosphere of dissolution of the strict borders between classical disciplines. New findings in the natural sciences and the development of new technologies enhance the possibilities and range of interference with matter in general.

New observation tools such as the atomic force microscope allow for investigation of matter on an ever-decreasing length scale. Biomolecules can be investigated in action. The new tools and methods also allow for manipulation on the scale of nanometers. Engineering at the molecular level, tailoring new structures and materials, even building of machine-like devices at this scale is increasingly becoming possible. The basis for such technological applications is the knowledge revealed in the biosciences as well as in nanoscience. Similar themes are now approached from different perspectives and disciplines, resulting in a fruitful exchange of concepts, methods and tools. As the tools of investigation can also be used for manipulation and generation of structures, new areas of application are attracting interest from manufacturers.

Bionanoscience focuses on the molecular building blocks of living cells. Nanotechnology enables the study and control of biomolecules, delivering new insights into surface properties as well as into the working of biological cells themselves. Nanobioconvergence potentially will revolutionize our understanding and practice of medicine. The integration of new molecules into cells allows for extended manipulation of cellular functions, such as gene regulation. These new possibilities are further investigated in the emerging new field of synthetic biology.

In manipulating the building blocks of matter, nanobioconvergence has implications on various areas – including health, environmental and social issues. Therefore, prospects, problems and potential risks are an important issue. Technological, environmental, societal, health, and safety issues must be addressed in research, societal studies, regulatory measures, and government policies. Societal implications of converging technologies should be judged using a balanced approach between the goals (leading to envisioned societal benefits) and unexpected consequences (which could be a combination of unexpected benefits and risks).

Simple physical models of diatom morphogenesis to drive experiment  

Over the last 200 million years, a number of aquatic unicellular eukaryotic organisms have evolved techniques to sequester and assemble biominerals into exogenous structures. The results seen today are high-fidelity, mineralized exoskeletons featuring patterned complex nanoscale ornamentations that defy synthesis in vitro. Among these organisms, diatoms are of particular topical importance due to their fundamental role in the carbon cycle, in food chains ascending to fish, and the potential value of their biosilica shells to developing nanotechnologies. Their species-specific mineralized shells, which putatively optimize mechanical strength for protection and light-harvestation for photosynthesis, have astoundingly diverse morphologies, with structures that span scales from 5 nm to 0.5 mm. At the finest scale are structures called pore occlusions, which in a matter of minutes assemble and solidify under ambient physiological conditions into roughly deterministic patterns that are conserved within species, but which vary between species. Very little is known about this diatom biosilica assembly, yet if the mechanisms are simple or synthetically imitable, or if they can be externally manipulated, then they are potentially of great interest to industry.

3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation, the Next Generation of Cell Culturing?  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Souza2012.pdf)

In vitro cell culturing is an essential process in emerging areas of biotechnology, such as stem cell research, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery. Traditional cell culturing is carried out in Petri dishes or media-filled flasks where cells usually attach onto a flat glass or plastic surface in a two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer. Cells grown in monolayers provide a poor representation of in vivo conditions and are widely acknowledged to be insufficient for demanding technological needs. Many schemes for three-dimensional (3D) culturing are being developed or marketed to address these challenges, such as bio-reactors or protein-based gel environments, but they typically suffer from high cost, low-throughput, poor scalability, complexity, or the presence of non-human biological factors that can alter cell behavior and preclude therapeutic use. The next generation of cell culturing tools should address these challenges in an integrated manner. In this presentation, I will give a general overview of today’s 3D cell culturing tools, and present what is thought to be the next generation of 3D cell culturing, 3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation. Cell culturing by magnetic levitation consists of a device (The Bio-AssemblerTM) based on magnetization of cells using nanoparticle assemblies (Nanoshuttle) and levitation of the cells by spatially varying magnetic fields. In addition to addressing many of the unmet practical challenges in 3D cell culturing, magnetic levitation fosters tissue formation with phenotypic morphogenesis and functionality. The presence of the magnetic field levitates and spatially guides cells together, therefore promoting rapid cell-cell interaction in a manner that allows cells self-assemble, expand, and migrate in 3D. Importantly, this process of 3D cellular self-assembly takes place without the influence of an artificial ECM, and our results have shown that cells start to generate their endogenous ECM (human primary pulmonary fibroblast and smooth muscle cells) and assemble cells into physiologically relevant 3D cellular structures within hours of levitation. Furthermore, the efficiency and spatial control when generating 3D cultures enables the application of this method towards in vitro and label-free cell based assays. In this lecture we will present a wound-healing assay, where 3D cultures are generated by culturing/levitating embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Our work shows the rate of wound closure can be used to quantitatively evaluate a dose-dependent response to ibuprofen (nephrotoxic agent), including determining the point of zero growth, which is in agreement with reported IC50 value with cultured HEK293 cells. We believe this simple assay has broad application in toxicity testing, cell-based drug discovery, and tissue engineering and reconstruction.

A biophysical model can explain the multiscale phenomenon of collinearity of clustered HOX genes  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/Papageorgiou2012.pdf)

Hox gene clusters are very frequent in many animal genomes and their role in development is pivotal. Particularly in vertebrates, intensive efforts have established several properties of Hox clusters. The collinearity of Hox gene expressions (spatial, temporal and quantitative) is a common feature of the vertebrates. During the last decade, genetic engineering experiments have revealed some important facets of collinearity during limb and trunk development in mice. Two models have been proposed to explain all these properties. On one hand the ‘two-phases model’ makes use of the molecular regulatory mechanisms acting on the Hox genes. On the other hand, the’biophysical model’ is based on the signals transduced inside the cell nucleus and the generation of forces which apply on the cluster and lead to a coordinated activation of Hox genes. The two models differ fundamentally and a critical and detailed comparison is presented. Furthermore, experiments are proposed for which the two models provide divergent predictions. The outcome of these experiments will help to decide which of the two models is valid (if any).

Biomechanics of development and organism-environment interactions  
[slides](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Education-and-Participation/blob/master/Embryo%20Physics/Presentations/vonDassow2012.pdf)  

In nature, developing organisms encounter numerous types of variation that influence the mechanics of the organism. Studying how embryos respond to this variation illuminates how biomechanics contributes to phenotypic variation. I will focus on two examples from my own work: frog (Xenopus laevis) gastrulation and bryozoan (Membranipora sp.) colony patterning. In the first case we have found that morphogenesis can be surprisingly insensitive to variation in the mechanical properties of the tissue. However, a simplified mechanical model might explain temperature-dependent variation in morphogenesis. Our lab has not found evidence that mechanotransductory signaling coordinates morphogenesis during frog gastrulation. However, such feedback processes are prominent in adult organisms. Due to its relatively simple geometry and direct interaction with the environment, the chimney system in colonies of the bryozoan Membranipora may provide a useful model system for studying how such feedback processes influence organism-environment interactions. Fluid flow influences chimney formation in ways that could explain patterns of phenotypic plasticity. Understanding such interactions between developmental biomechanics and the environment will be valuable for deciphering the causes of developmental defects and the evolution of developmental mechanisms.
