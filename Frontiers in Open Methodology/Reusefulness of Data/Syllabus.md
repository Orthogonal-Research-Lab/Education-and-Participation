## Open course module on reusefulness of data.  
### All Content CC-BY 4.0.  

Part of the "[Frontiers in Open Methodology](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/NTg0NTkyMjE0Njda)" course on Google Classroom. Be sure to join the course [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/OrthogonalLabEd/community) for further discussion.

### Introduction
The Open Science movement has provided us with the increased formal sharing of so-called primary data. As these datasets are reused in diverse ways, there is a need to create new workflows for public consumption and further transformation. This provides us with new opportunities for scientific discovery. This new view of data also requires us to think more deeply about infrastructure for transforming primary data into secondary and tertiary data. This module also provides an outline as to the architecture of such a infrastructure in addition to practical examples from an ongoing research project. We also provide practical exercises for various data reuse strategies.

</p>

#### II. Review Data Reuse as a Process:  

I. primary, secondary, tertiary.  

II. primary to secondary data.  

III. combinations of secondary data.  

IV. secondary to tertiary data.  


#### III. Review of Data Reuse Principles:  

I. recycling data with respect to [explainable methods](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-III-Explainable-Methods) and [theory-building](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-I-reproducible-theory-building).  

II. maintaining context and transformed data.  

III. building communities around access to data.

#### IV. digital badge (microcredential) for data reusability.

1. Data Reusability I: primary to tertiary forms.  

* integration, munging, and attribution/licensing.  
    
2. Data Reusability II: pipelines, annotation, community. 

* data reuse and the scientific method, data context, collaboration around data.

#### VI. Potential exercises (one or more can be chosen by the learner):  

I. Annotate a toy dataset.  

   1. download [this dataset](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-II-reusefulness-of-data/tree/master/Sample%20Data), and show how the annotation information included within can be used to make for a more comprehensive reanalysis. Potential additions include [stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) of the data by time or type, identity, or some other attribute. Please resubmit a revised version of the same file.
   
   * push assignments to the [Push Assignments Here](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-II-reusefulness-of-data/tree/master/Push%20Assignments%20Here) folder in this directory corresponding to course topic. Format for file name: FirstName_LastName_I.foo
   
II. Draw a data re-use pipeline and create repository.  

   1. As shown in the lecture, a data re-use pipeline considers potential re-use needs for two generations of the data lifecycle. Please create a diagram that labels components of a two generation re-use pipeline for your particular project.

   2. [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) offers [an approach to data reuse](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/data_reuse/) that involves creating a checklist of details for primary datasets. Please fork the orginal repository and [fill out this template](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md). Once you are done, submit a version to the course assignments repository.

III. Build your own version-controlled project repository and directory.

   * push the static URL link to the [Push Assignments Here](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-II-reusefulness-of-data/tree/master/Push%20Assignments%20Here) folder in this directory corresponding to course topic. Format for file name: FirstName_LastName_III.foo
   
IV. Write an essay discussing the attitudes and norms of data sharing in your specific field.
