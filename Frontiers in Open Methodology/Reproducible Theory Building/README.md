## Open course module on reproducible theory-building.  
### All Content CC-BY 4.0.  

Part of the "[Frontiers in Open Methodology](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/NTg0NTkyMjE0Njda)" course on Google Classroom. Be sure to join the course [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/OrthogonalLabEd/community) for further discussion.

### Introduction
Theory-building is a lesser-known skill in the area of science. With the rising popularity of open science and big data we also need methods for reproducible theory-building. Approaching the topic using a mix of philsophy, statistics, systems modeling, and bibliometric tools, this module will educate people on how to engage in theory-building in addition to developing their own robust approach. This will also hopefully encourage people to think more deeply about how to interpret their own data and cnsider where it fits into the existing scientific literature.

III) digital badge (microcredential) for theory-building.


#### Basic Theory-building:

I) theory-building as a meta-process (modeling based on empirical observation).  

II) theory-building as propositional statements.  

III) philosophical perspective (Kuhnian, Popperian, and Naive).  

IV) reasoning through constructs and literature-based synthesis.  


#### Guidelines for achieving reproducible theory-building:  

I) collective field-mapping and reference use.  

   1) finding out where your research area of interest lies in the scientific literature.  

II) boxes and arrows approaches.  

   2) visualizing the components of your research area of interest.  

III) simulation and complexity approaches.  

   3) characterizing your research area of interest as a interactive, generative, dynamic phenomenon.  

IV) leveraging dark data.  

   4) widening the empirical window of your research area of interest.

#### Potential exercises (one or more can be chosen by the learner):

I) build a graphical relationship (bivariate, interactive, volumetric).

   1) download sample data for all three data types from [this directory](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-I-reproducible-theory-building/tree/master/Sample%20Data).
 
   2) use a simulation or Jupyter Notebook to plot various relationships. Annotate your results.

II) build a theoretical model.

   1) develop a framework of statements.

   2) select a philosophical approach.

   3) construct a formal graph out of your framework and philosophical assumptions.
