This repo is dedicated to mapping out basic areas of knowledge needed (or need to be augmented) for interdisciplinary collaboration. 

* education and mini-courses.

* knowledge maps and finding the connections between unsynthesized literature (lack of overlap). 

* short-term planning and switching between fields (focus on issues in one field, this leads you to another)<sup>1</sup>.

Hedgehogs and Foxes game: 

* hedgehogs look for simplification in terms of cause and effect, limited to a domain of expertise.

* foxes look for complexity and overarching patterns rather then cause and effect.

We can accomodate both foxes and hedgehogs given our interests in both niche topics and broad, interdisciplinary collaboration. Below is a payoff matrix for each strategy, not taking into account the relative needs of and contributions to specific projects.

Table 1. Payoffs for {Foxes, Hedgehogs} given three strategies to solve a given problem. Vertical (foxes) and Horizontal (hedgehogs). Payoffs are arbitrary, generated by importance of each strategy relative to individual style.
