This repo is dedicated to mapping out basic areas of knowledge needed (or need to be augmented) for interdisciplinary collaboration. 

* education and mini-courses.

* knowledge maps and finding the connections between unsynthesized literature.

Hedgehogs and Foxes game: 

* hedgehogs look for simplification in terms of cause and effect, limited to a domain of expertise.

* foxes look for complexity and overarching patterns rather then cause and effect.
